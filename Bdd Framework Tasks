What are we planning to Achieve?
-> BDD Framework creation from Scratch which is supported in Azure CI/CD Pipeline.

How to Achieve it?
-> Complete below Tasks which are specifically assigned for you
-> Once you complete your assigned task, Document it in an understandable manner so that other 2 resources can refer
-> At last Combine all the 8 Tasks into one common project (Before combining, Get your individual codes reviewed by me)

Things to Avoid:
-> Don't Create all the Tasks in one common Package, Maintain separate packages for all 8 tasks for better understanding
-> Don't use irrelevant names for classes or methods or any Strings(Ex: TestClass, TestMethod, temp, count)

Good to Have:
-> Always derive variables on start of the method or class
-> Maintain code Quality(Try to re use the common methods)

When can we club our 8 individual tasks & Streamline it as a Azure Supported BDD Framework?
-> Once your code is reviewed, I will help in integrating all of these 8 tasks

By when should we Achieve this?
-> By Day 5

Task 1:
How to call a static & non static method from another class?

Task 2:
TestNG Annotations(@Test, @BeforeMethod, @AfterMethod, @BeforeClass, @AfterClass, @BeforeTest, @AfterTest, @BeforeSuite, @AfterSuite,dependsOnMethods)
Parallel Execution in TestNG( Suite-level parallelism,  Method-level parallelism,  Class-level parallelism)

Task 3:
Cucumber Feature File Creation(Given, When, Then, And, But, Scenario, Scenario Outline, Feature)
Step Definition Creation for above Keywords

Task 4:
Extent Reports Creation(createTest, createNode)

Task 5:
Input Spread sheet(Take 3*3 Table data from spreadsheet; Store it in a list & print it in the console)
Output Excel sheet(Try to pump the 3*3 table data taken from input sheet to a new Spreadsheet)

Task 6:
Git Commit - Commit your code to GIT Repo

Task 7:
Azure CICD - Create a Testing pipeline & Run your code

Task 8:
Locators -> (All the 8 locators &  Text equals, Text Contains)
